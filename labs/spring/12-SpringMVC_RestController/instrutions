From Browser :

Access the REST Endpoint, since we have included the jackson-dataformat-xml.jar in classpath, the 
response we  will get will be XML.

http://localhost:8080/Spring4MVCHelloWorldRestServiceDemo/hello/Messi


If We want Spring to serve JSON response instead, you can either
– remove the jackson-dataformat-xml.jar [comment it in pom.xml, build and deploy it again].
– Or Suffix the URL with .json


Using Postman:

Set the ‘Accept’ request header [to appliction/json or application/xml ] and send the request. Check the response body:

http://localhost:8080/Spring4MVCHelloWorldRestServiceDemo/hello/Messi
